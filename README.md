What whent well?
I was able to get a basic grasp of coding in java. I now know about classes, objects, sql, html and how to create projects in spring boot. The things that went well 
was that I was able to create a basic web app with java, html, CSS and mySQL. 

How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected it to go much better than how it went. I expected my project to have finnished by the end of the deadline and have a fully fledged banking software. 

What went well?
i was able to create a basic layout for my banking software. i was able to link data from eclipse to mySQL in a seamless manner. 

What didnt go to plan?
I expected us to have completed the essantials of learning that was needed for this project. However the essentials weren't completed until the last two days meaning the project that i thought I was doing correctly had to be drastically changed due to the new information. 
This lead me into not finishing the project properly on time as i only had two days to uncloud my confutions and relearn how to do things the correct way. 

Future improvements.
Some future improvements could be learning the essentials needed for the project well in advance before we learn about some of the other outdated ways of coding as this would help us greately in time management and finishing the project on the deadline.
